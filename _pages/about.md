Hello and welcome to my personal site!

I'm an undergraduate student studying physics and mathematics at NYU. I have broad interests in the far ends of physics and math as well as where they intersect. Currently I'm researching the string spectrum in AdS, topological phases, and hyperuniform systems. I am also developing 3D superconducting microwave cavities. 

If you have any questions please don't hesitate to reach out!
